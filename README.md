#### Notes
It is an example of data presentation in a pagination table, and CRUD functionality.

#### Users
It is a simple example of how to manage registered users.

#### Menu management 
It is a system that allows you to create a new menu and edit existing menus. To place a new menu named "new" in any view use this code:
```php
        <?php
            use the App\MenuBuilder\FreelyPositionedMenus;
            if(isset($appMenus['new'])){
                FreelyPositionedMenus::render( $appMenus['new'] , '', 'your-css-class-of-ul-element');
            }
        ?>  
```
#### Manage menu items
Allows you to add, edit and delete menu items.
To add a new menu item to the menu you must:
* specify to which menu you are adding the item,
* specify the roles of users for whom the item will be visible
* name the item
* type ( to choice: link, title and dropdown)
* Href, the address to which the item is to refer,
* Parent (To nest the item inside dropdown)
* CORUI icons

#### Role management
Allows you to create, edit, delete and reorder user roles.
When a user has more than one role, the highest hierarchical role is used to create a menu for him.

#### Manage media
It allows to:
* Create virtual media folders.
* Send media to applications.
* Move media between folders,
* Cut images,

#### BREAD system
BREAD stands for: browse, read, edit, add, delete.
Our BREAD system allows you to easily and quickly generate for any table, from the database, a simple BREAD.
To create a new BREAD just enter a table name from the database.  Then enter a name for the form. Enter the number of rows in the browse table. Choose if you want the browse table to contain buttons: "show", "edit", "add", "delete".
Assign roles for users who will be able to use the ready BREAD.
Then complete each column of the table separately:
* the column name visible to the user,
* the input type for the column,
The last step is to select the appropriate checkboxes:
* browse (allows to display the column in the data table),
* read (allows you to display the column in the show view,)
* edit (enables column editing)
* add (allows you to complete the column data when adding a record. Required if the column is not nullable).
It is also possible to handle relationships with another table.
If the column is a foreign key, it should be specified: in the field "Optional relation table name" - table name to which the foreign key refers, in the "Optional column name in relation table - to print" field - the name of the column that is in the relation table to be displayed. Finally, select one of the two "field types" that relate to the relation: 'relation select' or 'relation radio'.

#### E-mail Templates
It is an example of managing e-mail templates. Allows you to create, edit and delete templates. It also allows you to send an E-mail to a selected address.

## Support CoreUI Development

CoreUI is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support development by donating on [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/holeczek), buying [CoreUI Pro Version](https://coreui.io/pro) or buying one of our [premium admin templates](https://genesisui.com/?support=1).

As of now I am exploring the possibility of working on CoreUI fulltime - if you are a business that is building core products using CoreUI, I am also open to conversations regarding custom sponsorship / consulting arrangements. Get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukaszholeczek).
